        <h1>OXYGEN</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Oxygen is an essential element for life. Patients who need constant oxygen at home or while they sleep are often prescribed home oxygen concentrators. Oxygen concentrators take air from your surroundings, extract oxygen, and filter it into purified oxygen for you to breathe. For Medicare Beneficiaries with Part B (Medicare FFS) or Part C Active, they can qualify to get their Oxygen paid by the federal health insurance. It helps cover two types of services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Medically necessary services: Services or supplies that meet accepted standards of medical practice to diagnose or treat your medical condition.</li>
                <li>Preventive services: Health care to prevent illness (like the flu) or detect it at an early stage when treatment is likely to work best. You pay nothing for most preventive services if you get the services from a health care provider who accepts assignment.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>DOCUMENTATION NEEDED (Within 90-day window):</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Chart Notes</b></li>
		<ul>
		<br>Areas we need to check on the notes: 
<li>Assessment / Plan (the diagnoses confirmed DURING the appointment) COPD </li>
<li>If PT visit had an acute lung diagnosis or infection, we could requalify PT for <u>only 3 months</u> </li>
<li>If PT was stable during visit with valid diagnosis, we can requalify as normal  </li> </br>
</ul>
                <li><b>Testing (6MWT / Titration Sleep Study / Overnight Oximetry Test) </b></li>
		<br>**VALID OXYGEN TESTING (SPO2 AT 88% OR BELOW ON ROOM AIR IS VALID) 

<br>FOR PORTABLE O2 – 6 MINUTE WALK TEST </br>

<p>Desaturation of 88% or below on room air at rest is already valid, but if room air at rest is 89% or above we would be requiring the PT to undergo a 6 minute walk test (DAYTIME TESTING) <p>

<ul>
Example format for a valid walk test WORD FOR WORD: 

<li>ROOM AIR AT REST – 94% </li>
<li>ROOM AIR WITH EXERTION/ AMBULATION – 83% </li>
<li>RECOVERY WITH O2 APPLIED – 93% on 3 LPM </li>
</ul>
  </br>

<ul>
<p>For NIGHTtime O2 use  </p>
 2 Types of Night time Testing:
<li>Overnight Oximetry on ROOM AIR (PT’s without OSA)   </li>

<li> Titration Sleep Study (Patiets diagnosed with OSA)  </li>
<br>   </br>
</ul>
